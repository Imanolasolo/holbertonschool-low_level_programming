## Dependences 

> [README.md](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/zero_day/blob/main/README.md) ---> README file to show the project insights. 

>[0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/Imanolasolo/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c) ---> This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable `n` is positive or negative.
